## 🐜 Debbugging - 

After running my html & css codes through validators I picked out various faults and errors that had to be altered to give the site the best performance, the main faults which the validators picked up was a error to one of the header photos and heading codes which were excesively used, since these errors were identified the appropriate changes have been made.
